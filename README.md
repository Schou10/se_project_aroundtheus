### Overview

- Intro
- Figma

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This web page is made to be reactive based on the size of the screen. As the screen changes different media queries are applied to make changed to the different flex and grid layouts of the site and makes modifications to specific elements as well.

**Technologies**

- Figma

Figma is what gave us the design for this project createdd by the designers at tripple ten it was also the tool to help me get all of the elements like pictures and logos that are used through out this project.

- HTML

Like any other project this was the starting point of my code. It is the structure of my layout and how I organized all of my elements inside my code. It provides links to all the css files has the correct meta tag set up that a viewer friendly website needs.

- CSS

I have organized my CSS files to follow the BEM structure of setting up multple CSS files that are inmported to the main index CSS file, which is linked to the main index HTML. There is a number of CSS files that are all indicated by the block structure in which each element in my HTML file is given a class to. This is the easiest way to structure and organize my CSS files to make the reactive changes this progect requires.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
